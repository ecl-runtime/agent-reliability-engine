Subject: Built a gate that blocks AI agent failures

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're building AI agents [context from their website/LinkedIn].

I analyzed why 95% of agents fail in production, and it comes down to 5 things:
- Ambiguous intent (refund ALL customers)
- Stale state reads (old balance → overdraft)
- Unbounded actions (email everyone)
- Irreversible damage (delete without backup)
- Black-box reasoning (no audit trail)

Built a gate that stops all 5 before agents act.

One-line integration:
```python
decision = are.can_execute(action, params, reasoning, state_deps)
if decision.allowed:
    execute()
Just launched on GitHub (open source, MIT).

Would love your feedback on the demo. Takes 2 minutes:
